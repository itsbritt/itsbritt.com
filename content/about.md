title: var me = this;
intro: I am a self-taught software engineer with over five years of professional
    experience in three of the major front end frameworks. Although I didn't know
    it at the time, as a philosophy major I was primed for a career in abstract
    thinking and problem solving. It wasn't until building my first website,
    however, that I knew I had found what I wanted to do. Since then, I've been
    doing my best to keep up with the constantly evolving JavaScript ecosystem and
    learning as much as possible along the way.
conclusion: After a period of coast-to-coast exploring, I'm currently settled In
    Austin, TX with my wife, Kelly and bulldog, Hugo.
