# Evergreen Notes

_Evergreen notes_ are written and organized to evolve, contribute, and accumulate over time, across topics. This style of note taking diverges from the more traditional form of note-taking. While it's convenient to quickly jot thoughts down in a transient manner, the note-taker is ultimately left with a collection of dissociated notes that are often discarded over time. As a result you're left with a bucket of random notes pertitent only to the current topic at hand.

An evergreen-based approach can improve the effectiveness of accumulating insight across multiple topics over an extended period of time. Here are some basic principles I've set out to follow in adopting this an evergreen-based approach.

2. Notes should be concept-oriented
3. Notes should be 

-   [[Evergreen notes should be atomic]]

-   [Evergreen notes should be densely linked]()
-   [Prefer associative ontologies to hierarchical taxonomies]()

When done well, these notes can be quite valuable: [Evergreen note-writing as fundamental unit of knowledge work](https://publish.obsidian.md/andymatuschak/Evergreen+note-writing+as+fundamental+unit+of+knowledge+work).
